## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements

#### Development Environment
- Python 3.8 or higher
- SQL Server ODBC Driver 17
- Configured AWS CLI with appropriate permissions

#### AWS Infrastructure
- RDS SQL Server instance
- Lambda execution environment
- EC2 instance for backup operations
- EventBridge scheduling rules

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository and create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your environment variables:
```bash
# Core Infrastructure
BASE_DIR=/home/ec2-user/nba_backup
SCRIPTS_DIR=/home/ec2-user/nba_backup/scripts

# Database Configuration
DB_SERVER=your-server.region.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_NAME=NBA_Database
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30
DB_LOGIN_TIMEOUT=30
DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=300

# Integration Points
KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
EC2_INSTANCE_ID=i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Performance Tuning
EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE=50000
PLAYER_STATS_CHUNK_SIZE=25000
LAMBDA_TIMEOUT=900
LAMBDA_MEMORY_SIZE=256
```

### Installation Guide

The installation process is streamlined through our automated environment setup script:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup_environment.sh

# Run the environment setup script
./setup_environment.sh
```

This script automates several key setup tasks:
- Creates and configures the Python virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies
- Sets up the ODBC driver for SQL Server
- Configures necessary system permissions
- Validates the environment configuration

## üíª Usage
